/The Great Wall of China, one of the most impressive architectural feats in history, stretches over 13,000 miles and was built over several dynasties, starting as early as the 7th century BC. Contrary to popular belief, the wall isn't a single continuous structure but a series of walls and fortifications. It's made from various materials, including earth, wood, bricks, and stone, depending on the region. The primary purpose of the wall was to protect against invasions and raids by nomadic groups from the north. However, it also served as a means of border control, allowing the regulation of trade along the Silk Road, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the route. The construction of the wall involved millions of laborers, including soldiers, peasants, and prisoners. It's estimated that up to 400,000 workers died during its construction, many of whom were buried within the wall itself. Its construction techniques were advanced for their time; for instance, some sections used sticky rice mortar, which has helped the wall withstand centuries of erosion and weathering. Interestingly, the Great Wall wasn't always effective in keeping invaders out. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan in the 13th century, and later the Manchus in the 17th century, managed to breach the wall and conquer China. Despite its mixed success as a military fortification, the Great Wall remains a symbol of China's enduring strength and resilience. Today, it attracts millions of tourists annually, making it one of the most visited landmarks in the world. In addition to its historical and cultural significance, the Great Wall has also been the subject of various myths and misconceptions. One popular myth is that the wall is visible from space with the naked eye. In reality, while it can be seen with the aid of telescopic lenses, it is not visible to the naked eye from low Earth orbit. The myth likely persists due to the wall's immense length and the awe it inspires.
